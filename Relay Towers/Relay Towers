loop through the storm heights
As each loop represents the storm levels, 
	Create an array/List indicating which all heights can be considered at this storm level
	sort the saved array to ensure
	Now loop through the saved array of heights
	find the difference between i and i-1 in the saved heights and compare that with maxJump value so
		if the distance is less than the maxJump 
			find the square of the distance to the towers (given)
			and find the culminative value

	check if the cul value is inside maxEnergy 
	if so save the storm level value for now, 
	after looping through all the storm values
return whatever is the storm level at the end of the loop
